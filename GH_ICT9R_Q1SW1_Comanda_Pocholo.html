			<h2>1. The Truman Show</h2>
			<p>I watched this during a flight!</p>
			<p>I like this movie because when Truman started to realize<br> that he was in a show for his whole life i got more <br>interested and wanted to see what he would do.</p>
			<h2>This is my favorite actor from the movie!</h2>
			<h3>Jim Carrey<br>(played as Truman Burbank)</h3>

			<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27203116/"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSP116EhmO3VxnheXSnc8Aljrwr0YZV4O31nN9Y9zY1EpnrYwwo" width="357"></a>
			<h2>2. Gomburza</h2>
			<p>I haven't finished it but it's awesome!</p>
			<p>I like this movie because I'm not really good with history (especially with Philippine history).<br> I learnt a bit more about Philippine history because personally this is more <br>fun than sitting down and reading about the topic.</p>
			<h2>Favorite actor from the movie!</h2>
			<h3>Cedrick Juan<br>(played as Jose Burgos)</h3>

		 	<h2>3. Neon Genesis Evangelion</h2>
		 	<p>Recently started watching the anime!</p>
		 	<p>I like this because I'm overall a general fan of anime and when I<br> watched the first episode I got really interested and started to watch more of it.</p>
		 	<h2>Favorite character from the anime!</h2>
